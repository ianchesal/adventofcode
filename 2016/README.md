# Advent of Code - 2016

The answers to the [2016 puzzles](http://adventofcode.com/2016). Everything is in Ruby 2.3. To run the solutions:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec bin/<script>

Most of the days have two parts to them (a `bin/dayNN_1 and a `bin/dayNN_2` script).

Input files are in the `day/` directory tree. If a day has multiple input files, the `input` file is the official file that had to be processed to solve the riddle and the rest of the files are test files used to debug the code.
