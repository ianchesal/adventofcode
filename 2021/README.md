# Advent of Code - 2021

The answers to the [2021 puzzles](http://adventofcode.com/2011). Everything is in Ruby 3.0.3. To run the solutions:

    rbenv install 3.0.3
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec bin/<script>

Input files are in the `day/` directory tree. If a day has multiple input files, the `input` file is the official file that had to be processed to solve the riddle and the rest of the files are test files used to debug the code.
